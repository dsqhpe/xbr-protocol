The **XBR Protocol** enables secure peer-to-peer data-trading and -service microtransactions in
`Open Data Markets <https://xbr.network>`__ between multiple independent entities.

XBR as a protocol sits on top of `WAMP <https://wamp-proto.org>`__, an open messaging middleware and service mesh technology,
and enables secure integration, trusted sharing and monetization of data and data-driven microservices
between different parties and users.

The XBR Protocol specification is openly developed and freely usable.

The protocol is implemented in *smart contracts* written in `Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io>`__
and open-source licensed (`Apache 2.0 <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/blob/master/LICENSE>`__).
Smart contracts are designed to run on the `Ethereum blockchain <https://ethereum.org/>`__.
All source code for the XBR smart contracts is developed and hosted in the
project main `GitHub repository <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol>`__.

The XBR Protocol and reference documentation can be found `here <https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/xbr.foundation/docs/protocol/index.html>`__.

**Application development with XBR**

The XBR smart contracts primary build artifacts are the `contract ABIs JSON files <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/tree/master/abi>`__.
The ABI files are built during compiling the `contract sources <https://github.com/crossbario/xbr-protocol/tree/master/contracts>`__.
Technically, the ABI files are all you need to interact and talk to the XBR smart contracts deployed to a blockchain
from any (client side) language or run-time that supports Ethereum, such as
`web3.js <https://web3js.readthedocs.io>`__ or `web3.py <https://web3py.readthedocs.io>`__.

However, this approach (using the raw XBR ABI files directly from a "generic" Ethereum client library) can be cumbersome
and error prone to maintain. An alternative way is using a client library with built-in XBR support.

The XBR project currently maintains the following **XBR-enabled client libraries**:

-  `Autobahn|Python <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python>`__ for Python 3.5+
-  `Autobahn|JavaScript <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js>`__ for JavaScript, in browser and NodeJS
-  `Autobahn|Java <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-java>`__ (*beta XBR support*) for Java on Android and Java 8 / Netty
-  `Autobahn|C++ <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-cpp>`__ (*XBR support planned*) for C++ 11+ and Boost/ASIO

XBR support can be added to any `WAMP client library <https://wamp-proto.org/implementations.html#libraries>`__
with a language run-time that has packages for Ethereum application development.
